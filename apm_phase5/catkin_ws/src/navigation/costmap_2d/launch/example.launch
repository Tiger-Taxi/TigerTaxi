  NOTE: You'll need to bring up something that publishes sensor data (see
  rosstage), something that publishes a map (see map_server), and something to
  visualize a costmap (see nav_view), to see things work.

  Also, on a real robot, you'd want to set the "use_sim_time" parameter to false, or just not set it.
